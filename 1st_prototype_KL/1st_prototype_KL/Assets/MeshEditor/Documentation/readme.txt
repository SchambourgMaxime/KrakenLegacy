Mesh Editor - Advanced Mesh Editing Utility
v1.3 - Released 04/10/2015 by Alan Baylis
----------------------------------------


Foreword
----------------------------------------
Thank you for your purchase of Mesh Editor. The program has recently had a complete rebuild. The feature list has grown very long and contains all of the functions you would expect in an advanced mesh editing utility. We aim to continue adding new features like combining/splitting vertices, bridging edges and many others. If you have a feature request then please let us know by writing to support@meshmaker.com.


Notes
----------------------------------------
If you are experiencing problems selecting vertices/triangles you can now change the epsilon value in the settings.

When extruding multiple triangles that meet at a single point they sometimes have inverted faces. The solution is to extrude the triangles individually.

All features work with skinned meshes except for extrusion.

To-do List.
----------------------------------------
Done - Extrusion and deformation of meshes
Done - Skinned mesh support
- Edge loops
- Bridge edges
- Combine/Split vertices
- Vertex snap
- Integrated GUI option
- Full mesh optimization
